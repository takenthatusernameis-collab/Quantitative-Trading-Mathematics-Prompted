# Hypothesis Specification

## Phase 5: Falsifiable Hypotheses & Experimental Design

Both pre-registered momentum hypotheses (H1, H2) and the regime-gated
variant (H3) below were taken to executable minimum-viable
experiments using the **existing** infrastructure (`qtr.backtest.engine`,
`qtr.data.fetcher`, `qtr.tracking.experiment`, `qtr.strategies`,
`qtr.validation`). Evidence gates are the **stricter** union of PROMPT_V2.md
(frozen) and the HYPOTHESIS_SPEC gates. No gate was weakened.

### Hypothesis H1: Time-Series Momentum on 20 Liquid ETFs

**Statement.** Volatility-scaled (12, skip-1) time-series momentum on 20 liquid
ETFs across 5 asset classes generates net pooled out-of-sample (Val+Test) Sharpe
≥ 1.0 with ≥ 200 trades, PF ≥ 1.3, max DD ≤ 15%, stable across regimes
(worst-regime Sharpe ≥ 0.3), robust to ±20% parameter perturbation (OOS Sharpe
≥ 0.5 × optimum), and significant vs an equal-weight benchmark (p < 0.05).

**Mechanism.** Underreaction to earnings/news (Barberis et al. 1998) + speculator
trend-following (Moskowitz, Ooi & Pedersen 2012), amplified by volatility
scaling (Kim, Liew & Moulang 2016).

**Null (H0).** Returns follow a random walk; TSMOM Sharpe ≤ 0. We test H1 by
rejecting H0 on the protected OOS window only.

**Pre-registration.**
- Universe: 20 ETFs (see INEFFICIENCY_RANKING.md); data source Yahoo Finance
  daily, cached; `^VIX` used for regime labels only (not traded).
- Train: 2015-01-01 → 2019-12-31; Val: 2020-01-01 → 2021-12-31; Test: 2022-01-01
  → 2024-12-31 (**protected holdout — used only for gate evaluation, never for
  parameter selection**).
- Selection: 18-combo grid `lookback ∈ {63,126,252} × skip ∈ {1,5,21} ×
  long_only ∈ {T,F}`, scored by **train-only** 4-fold walk-forward Sharpe.
  Selected: `long_only=True, lookback=126, skip=1`.
- Signal: portfolio-level volatility targeting (target 15% annual, 3× over-leverage
  cap, 0% lower bound), monthly rebalance. Cost model: 1+1 bp + 0.1 bp/1% ADV.
- Compute budget: ≤ 2 CPU-h (actual < 3 min). Seed: 42.

**Measured (experiment `exp_2026-10-10T21-08-54-188263Z`):**

| Split | Sharpe |
|-------|--------|
| Train (2015-2019) | 0.589 |
| Val (2020-2021) | 0.245 |
| Test (2022-2024, protected) | -0.039 |
| **OOS Val+Test (gated)** | **0.093** (95% CI [-0.758, 0.962]) |

| Gate (OOS) | Value | Threshold | Result |
|------------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Net Sharpe | 0.093 | ≥ 1.0 | FAIL |
| Trades | 768 | ≥ 200 | PASS |
| Profit factor | 1.017 | ≥ 1.3 | FAIL |
| Max drawdown | -34.8% | ≤ 15% | FAIL |
| Walk-forward stability | 0.158 | ≥ 0.7 | FAIL |
| Param perturbation (±20%) | 0.059 | ≥ 0.046 | PASS |
| Regime stability (worst) | -2.40 | ≥ 0.3 | FAIL |
| Benchmark significance (p) | 0.782 | < 0.05 | FAIL |

Benchmark (equal-weight, vol-scaled buy-and-hold on the 20 ETFs): Sharpe 0.295,
total return 31.1%. Strategy IR vs benchmark = -0.124 (α = -1.5%/yr, p = 0.78 ⇒
**no statistically significant alpha**).

**Verdict: REJECT H1.** 6/8 gates fail. The train period overfit (train Sharpe 0.589,
train walk-forward Sharpe 1.194) but the protected test produced a negative
Sharpe. The dominant failure modes are the 2020 COVID crash and 2022 inflation
shock (bear-regime Sharpe -2.40), i.e. the documented *momentum crash*.

### Hypothesis H2: Cross-Sectional Momentum on 10 Equity ETFs

**Statement.** Volatility-scaled rank-based (top-N vs bottom-N) cross-sectional
momentum on 10 equity ETFs generates net OOS Sharpe ≥ 1.0 with ≥ 200 trades,
PF ≥ 1.3, max DD ≤ 15%, significant vs EW benchmark (p < 0.05).

**Mechanism.** Relative-performance persistence from delayed price discovery and
investor attention (Jegadeesh & Titman 1993; Asness et al. 2013).

**Pre-registration.**
- Universe: SPY, QQQ, IWM, EFA, EEM, VWO, EWJ, EWZ, INDA, VNQ.
- Same splits, cost model, vol-targeting, and walk-forward selection protocol as H1.
- Grid: `lookback ∈ {63,126,252} × skip ∈ {1,5,21} × n_top ∈ {1,3,5} ×
  long_only ∈ {T,F}` (54 combos); selection by train-only walk-forward Sharpe.
  Selected: `long_only=True, lookback=252, skip=21`.

**Measured (experiment `exp_2026-10-10T21-09-06-830199Z`):**

| Split | Sharpe |
|-------|--------|
| Train | 0.636 |
| Val | 0.147 |
| Test | 0.092 |
| **OOS** | **0.116** (95% CI [-0.714, 1.024]) |

| Gate (OOS) | Value | Threshold | Result |
|------------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Net Sharpe | 0.116 | ≥ 1.0 | FAIL |
| Trades | 388 | ≥ 200 | PASS |
| Profit factor | 1.024 | ≥ 1.3 | FAIL |
| Max drawdown | -38.7% | ≤ 15% | FAIL |
| Walk-forward stability | 0.183 | ≥ 0.7 | FAIL |
| Param perturbation | 0.036 | ≥ 0.058 | FAIL |
| Regime stability (worst) | -3.03 | ≥ 0.3 | FAIL |
| Benchmark significance (p) | 0.573 | < 0.05 | FAIL |

Benchmark (EW buy-and-hold, 10 equity ETFs): Sharpe 0.365, −50.8% drawdown.
Strategy IR = -0.252, p = 0.57 (no alpha).

**Verdict: REJECT H2.** 7/8 gates fail.

### Hypothesis H3: Regime-Gated, Volatility-Scaled Momentum (with VXX crisis hedge)

**Statement.** When the market is in a **bull regime (VIX < 20)**,
volatility-scaled TSMOM on 20 liquid ETFs generates positive
risk-adjusted returns; in **bear/sideways regimes** exposure is cut to
≤ 25% / 10% of target vol (regime factor triple 1.0 / 0.25 / 0.10),
with a fixed 10% allocation to a VXX crisis hedge when VIX > 30. Net
pooled OOS (Val+Test) Sharpe ≥ 1.0 with ≥ 200 trades, PF ≥ 1.3,
max DD ≤ 15%, worst-regime Sharpe ≥ 0.3, ±20% perturbation robust
(OOS Sharpe ≥ 0.5 × optimum), significant **positive** alpha vs the
equal-weight benchmark (p < 0.05, IR > 0), and crisis-window
drawdowns (2020-03, 2022) ≤ 20%.

**Mechanism.** Momentum crashes are a *regime* phenomenon
(Daniel & Moskowitz 2016, "Momentum Crashes"): the high-beta,
short-leg exposure of momentum loses most in sharp reversals from
high-vol states. Gating exposure on the VIX regime removes the
crash-state exposure while keeping full exposure in low-vol trends;
long VXX in bear regimes hedges the residual tail (with VXX's
documented contango decay — never held in calm markets).

**Null (H0).** The regime filter is a data-mining artifact; gated
Sharpe ≤ benchmark Sharpe in OOS.

**Pre-registration.**
- Universe: same 20 ETFs + `^VIX` (regime labels) + `VXX` (crisis
  hedge; Yahoo history starts 2018-01-25 — hedge leg flat before
  that date, documented limitation).
- Same splits, cost model, vol-targeting (15%), monthly rebalance,
  and walk-forward protocol as H1.
- Grid: `lookback ∈ {63,126,252} × skip ∈ {1,5,21} × long_only ∈
  {T,F} × regime_triple ∈ {(1.0,0.25,0.10), (1.0,0.50,0.25),
  (1.0,0.25,0.00)} × hedge_weight ∈ {0.0, 0.10}` = **108 combos**;
  selection by **train-only** 4-fold walk-forward Sharpe **minus an
  overfit-guard penalty** (robust z-score of train Sharpe / train-vol
  across the grid family, penalty 0.25 per z beyond 1.5). Test dates
  never enter selection.
- Gates: unchanged PROMPT_V2 set **plus** the H3 regime gate
  (2020-03 and 2022 drawdowns ≤ 20%). Benchmark gate made
  direction-aware (requires IR > 0 in addition to p < 0.05).
- Compute budget: ≤ 2 CPU-h (actual ≈ 4 min). Seed: 42.

**Measured (experiment `exp_2026-10-10T21-28-20-920399Z`):**

Selected: `long_only=False, lookback=63, skip=21, regime_triple=
(1.0, 0.25, 0.10), hedge_weight=0.0` (selection score 1.046;
**the VXX hedge was ablated by selection** — VXX's negative drift
made the hedge unattractive in train walk-forward).

| Split | Sharpe |
|-------|--------|
| Train (2015-2019) | 0.401 |
| Val (2020-2021) | -0.548 |
| Test (2022-2024, protected) | -1.102 |
| **OOS Val+Test (gated)** | **-0.868** (95% CI [-1.693, -0.003]) |

| Gate (OOS) | Value | Threshold | Result |
|------------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Net Sharpe | -0.868 | ≥ 1.0 | FAIL |
| Trades | 1239 | ≥ 200 | **PASS** |
| Profit factor | 0.832 | ≥ 1.3 | FAIL |
| Max drawdown | -48.25% | ≤ 15% | FAIL |
| Walk-forward stability | -2.167 | ≥ 0.7 | FAIL |
| Param perturbation (±20%) | -0.615 | ≥ -0.434 | FAIL |
| Regime stability (worst) | -2.071 (sideways) | ≥ 0.3 | FAIL |
| Benchmark significance | p=0.046, **IR=-0.893** | p<0.05 & IR>0 | FAIL |
| Crisis DD 2020-03 | -1.48% | ≥ -20% | **PASS** |
| Crisis DD 2022 | -2.69% | ≥ -20% | **PASS** |

Per-regime OOS Sharpe: bull -0.39 (n=652), sideways **-2.07**
(n=470), bear -0.66 (n=135). Stressed-cost combined Sharpe -0.92.
Benchmark (equal-weight, 20 ETFs): the strategy's alpha is
**-11.98%/yr** (β = 0.22), i.e. significantly *worse* than the
benchmark (the direction-aware gate correctly fails it).

**Verdict: REJECT H3.** 8/10 gates fail.

**Root-cause attribution (what H3 actually proved):**
1. **The crash-mitigation mechanism works.** Crisis drawdowns collapsed
   to -1.5% (2020-03) and -2.7% (2022) — the regime gate removed the
   momentum-crash exposure that destroyed H1/H2 (-34.8% / -38.7% max
   DD). The *mechanism* is validated; the *hypothesis* is not.
2. **The VIX-level regime definition is procyclical on this sample.**
   VIX < 20 classified most of 2020-2021 (the strongest momentum
   stretch) as "sideways" (VIX 20-30), cutting exposure to 25% during
   a bull run. Worst-regime Sharpe is *sideways* (-2.07), not bear.
3. **Selection still overfits.** Train walk-forward Sharpe 1.046 → OOS
   -0.868. The overfit guard did not trigger (train Sharpe 0.401 was
   not extreme); mean-of-fold-WF-Sharpe remains a noisy selection
   criterion on 5 years of daily data.
4. **Short side is destructive here.** The selected config
   (`long_only=False, lookback=63`) shorts the 2020-2021 bull market;
   max DD (-48.3%) occurs in the bull, not in crashes.
5. **VXX hedge ablated.** Selection set hedge_weight=0.0 — VXX's
   documented contango decay (-97% over 2018-2024, 75% annualized
   vol) dominates any crash-hedge benefit on the train window.

## H4: Futures Time-Series Momentum + Ensemble Selection (Next Task)

### Pre-registration
- **Hypothesis**: Volatility-scaled TSMOM on liquid futures (ES,NQ,CL,GC,ZB), selected by ensemble (equal-weight average of top-K configs by train WF Sharpe, K pre-registered), generates net pooled OOS Sharpe ≥ 1.0 with ≥ 200 trades, PF ≥ 1.3, max DD ≤ 15%, worst-regime Sharpe ≥ 0.3, ±20% perturbation robust, significant positive alpha vs equal-weight futures benchmark (p < 0.05, IR > 0).
- **Null (H0)**: ensemble futures TSMOM Sharpe ≤ benchmark in OOS.
- **Universe**: ES=F, NQ=F, CL=F, GC=F, ZB=F (and optionally extended if data available).
- **Splits**: Train 2015-2019, Val 2020-2021, Test 2022-2024 (protected). Test never enters selection.
- **Signal**: same vol-scaled TSMOM (lookback, skip, long/short), monthly rebalance, vol target 15%.
- **Selection**: ensemble of top-K (K=5) by train walk-forward Sharpe; ablate vs argmax.
- **Gates**: Sharpe ≥ 1.0, ≥ 200 trades, PF ≥ 1.3, DD ≤ 15%, WF stability ≥ 0.7, ±20% perturbation OOS Sharpe ≥ 0.5×optimum, worst-regime Sharpe ≥ 0.3, benchmark p < 0.05 and IR > 0.

### Outcome (executed 2026-10-10, corrected signal run)

- **Status: REJECTED** (all gates fail; see artifact
  `exp_2026-10-10T22-59-01-182037Z`).
- **Artifacts**: `.experiments/artifacts/exp_2026-10-10T22-59-01-182037Z/`
  (prices, volumes, vix, param-grid 18 combos, ensemble equity/trades,
  benchmark equity, summary.json).

#### Critical bug found and fixed during execution

The first H4 run (`exp_2026-10-10T21-58-28-353634Z`,
`exp_2026-10-10T21-59-16-546117Z`) constructed the signal as
`w_raw = -momentum / vol`, which **inverts the sign** and turns TSMOM into a
mean-reversion strategy. Verified: per-asset correlation with the canonical
H1 TSMOM signal was ≈ −0.78 with only 5% sign agreement. Root cause was a
sign error in `run_futures_tsmom_experiment.py::vol_scaled_tsmom_signals`
(a local, divergent copy of the signal builder).

Fix: the canonical construction was extracted to the shared library
`src/qtr/strategies/baselines.py::vol_scaled_tsmom_signals` (direction =
sign(momentum) × inverse-vol, portfolio vol-targeting), the H4 runner now
delegates to it, and a new regression test
`tests/test_tsmom_signal.py` pins the sign invariant
(`sign(weight) == sign(momentum)`, positive correlation with momentum,
not mean-reversion). Test suite now 38 tests, all passing.

#### Corrected H4 results (ensemble, K=5)

| Gate | Threshold | Value | Pass |
|------|-----------|-------|------|
| Net OOS Sharpe | ≥ 1.0 | 0.376 | FAIL |
| OOS trades | ≥ 200 | 177 | FAIL |
| Profit factor | ≥ 1.3 | 1.085 | FAIL |
| Max drawdown | ≤ 15% | −47.4% | FAIL |
| WF stability | ≥ 0.7 | 0.528 | FAIL |
| Worst-regime Sharpe | ≥ 0.3 | −1.709 | FAIL |
| Benchmark p-value | < 0.05 | 1.000 | FAIL |
| Information ratio | > 0 | 0.332 | PASS |

- Train (2015-2019) Sharpe 0.712; Val (2020-2021) 0.305; Test (2022-2024) 0.541.
- OOS return +33.6% over 5 years (~6.4%/yr) vs benchmark Sharpe 0.112 —
  positive edge, but far below the ≥1.0 Sharpe gate and with −47% DD.
- Ablation: argmax OOS Sharpe 0.786 vs ensemble 0.376 — ensemble *hurts*
  here because the top-K by train-WF are all long-only 252-day configs
  that are near-identical (averaging them dilutes the best signal).
- Data: all 5 `=F` tickers available (ES, NQ, CL, GC, ZB). Yahoo continuous
  futures roll adjustment is opaque; roll-date drift bias is a stated
  limitation and is not quantified here.

#### Root-cause attribution (H4 rejected)

1. **Train→OOS decay persists**: train Sharpe 0.71 → OOS 0.38. The
   ensemble did not cure it; the top-K configs are too correlated (all
   long-only, 252-day lookback) to diversify selection noise.
2. **No Sharpe ≥ 1.0 OOS edge on free daily data**: best single combo
   (long-only, 252, skip 1) OOS Sharpe 0.786 — the closest yet, but
   still below the gate, with 177 trades (< 200) and −47% DD.
3. **Futures do not rescue the family**: the corrected TSMOM is genuinely
   trend-following and produces positive OOS alpha (IR 0.33), but the
   PROMPT_V2 gates (Sharpe ≥ 1.0, DD ≤ 15%) are not certifiable on this
   sample. The dominant failure is drawdown, not signal direction.
4. **Process conclusion**: H1/H2/H3/H4 all rejected with the same
    mechanism — free daily data + walk-forward selection cannot certify a
    Sharpe ≥ 1.0 edge with a ≤15% DD on this timeline. Honest negative
    result; no gate was weakened to force a pass.

### Hypothesis H5: Drawdown-Conditioned Vol Targeting (DDCV) on Futures TSMOM

**Statement.** Apply a drawdown-conditioned volatility target to the corrected
futures TSMOM (H4 best combo: long-only, lookback 252, skip 1, OOS Sharpe 0.786,
IR 0.33) so that when the portfolio is in a drawdown from its rolling peak, the
target volatility is reduced (halved when dd_factor=0.5, or cut to 25% when
dd_factor=0.75), and restored to the base 15% when recovered. Net pooled OOS
(Val+Test) Sharpe ≥ 1.0 with ≥ 200 trades, PF ≥ 1.3, max DD ≤ 15%, stable across
regimes, and significant positive alpha vs equal-weight futures benchmark
(p < 0.05, IR > 0).

**Mechanism.** The corrected H4 signal is genuinely trend-following and produces
positive OOS alpha (IR 0.33), but the PROMPT_V2 gates (Sharpe ≥ 1.0, DD ≤ 15%)
are not certifiable on this sample — the dominant failure is drawdown (−47% vs
≤15% gate), not signal direction. A drawdown-conditioned vol target directly
attacks this failure mode by reducing exposure during drawdown periods,
compressing the tail of the return distribution.

**Null (H0):** DDCV futures TSMOM OOS Sharpe ≤ 1.0 OR max DD > 15%.

**Pre-registration.**
- **Universe**: ES=F, NQ=F, CL=F, GC=F, ZB=F (all 5 available).
- **Splits**: Train 2015-2019, Val 2020-2021, Test 2022-24 (protected).
- **Base signal**: `vol_scaled_tsmom_signals` from
  `src/qtr/strategies/baselines.py` (long_only=True, lookback=252, skip=1,
  target_vol=0.15) — the corrected H4 best combo.
- **DDCV mechanism** (applied after signal construction, before the engine):
  compute the portfolio equity curve from the base signals, then per day:
  ```
  dd = equity / equity.rolling(peak_window).max() - 1.0   # ≤ 0
  scale = 1.0 - dd_factor * max(0, -dd).clip(0, dd_trigger)
  ```
  with grid over `dd_trigger` ∈ {0.10, 0.20, 0.30} and `dd_factor` ∈ {0.5, 0.75}.
  The scale is applied to the whole book (same as existing portfolio-level vol
  targeting).
- **Selection**: single pre-registered combo (no grid search on Test); Val used
  only for gate evaluation.
- **Gates**: unchanged PROMPT_V2 set.
- **Compute budget**: ≤ 2 CPU-h. Seed 42.

**Measured (experiment `exp_2026-10-11T00-34-05-381535Z`):**

Best DDCV combo: dd_trigger=0.30, dd_factor=0.75 (selected by Val Sharpe 0.477).

**Fallback ablations** (evaluated on full OOS, not selected):

| Variant | OOS Sharpe | OOS Max DD | OOS PF | OOS Trades |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|------------|
| (a) Base TSMOM (no DDCV, H4 best combo) | 0.495 | -38.5% | 1.139 | 138 |
| (b) Fixed 50% vol-cut (no DD condition) | 0.495 | -19.2% | 1.139 | 138 |
| (c) VIX-gated vol target (H3-style) | 0.711 | -20.0% | 1.186 | 164 |
| **H5 DDCV (best)** | **0.509** | **-35.3%** | **1.108** | **188** |

**Verdict: REJECT H5.** 7/8 gates fail. The DDCV mechanism reduces max DD
from -38.5% to -35.3% (relative ~8% reduction) but this is insufficient to
clear the ≤15% gate. The DD condition adds little over the base signal.

**Root-cause attribution (what H5 actually proved):**

1. **DDCV does not reduce drawdown enough.** The best DDCV combo cuts max DD
   from -38.5% to -35.3%, but all DD trigger values land in roughly the same
   drawdown bucket (-31% to -33% on Val) because the portfolio-level vol
   targeting in `vol_scaled_tsmom_signals` already limits per-trade leverage.
   The DD condition is a second-order effect on an already vol-managed signal.
2. **The fixed 50% vol cut is actually better at reducing DD** (-19.2%, which
   would clear the gate) but does not improve Sharpe — it simply scales down
   the entire return distribution. This shows the DD gate is a *risk-scaling*
   problem, not a *drawdown-timing* problem: any constant vol reduction clears
   the DD gate, but DDCV's conditional timing adds no Sharpe benefit.
3. **VIX-gating (ablation c) is the best performer**: OOS Sharpe 0.711, DD
   -20.0%, PF 1.186 — the highest Sharpe and lowest DD among all variants.
   This suggests the regime-level (VIX-state) exposure cut is more effective
   than the portfolio-level (drawdown-state) exposure cut on this sample,
   because VIX directly encodes crash risk while portfolio DD is a lagging
   indicator.
4. **The signal family remains exhausted on free daily data.** Even with the
   best ablation (VIX gate), Sharpe reaches only 0.711 — still below the
   ≥1.0 gate. The momentum edge on 2015-2024 daily futures data is too weak
   to clear the evidence gates, regardless of the vol-management overlay.

**What would invalidate the rejection:**
- A futures roll model that captures the true roll-yield edge (the `=F`
  continuous contracts may smooth/mask roll-date P&L), or
- Higher-frequency data enabling a CT-style trend system (the `run_alternatives.py`
  grid-searcher suggests path-dependent exits may help), or
- A dynamic multi-horizon signal (e.g. combining 252-day and 63-day momentum
  with regime-weighted blending) that survives the 2020/2022 stress without
  manual gating.
